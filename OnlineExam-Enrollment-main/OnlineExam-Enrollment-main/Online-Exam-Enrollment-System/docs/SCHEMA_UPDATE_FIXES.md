# Database Schema Update Fixes

## Issues Fixed for New Database Schema

### ✅ **1. Missing `time_slots.end_time` Column**

**Problem**: Code was querying `end_time` column that doesn't exist in new schema
**Solution**: Updated queries to only use `start_time` and calculate `end_time` as `start_time + 2 hours`

**Files Updated**:

- `SchedulingService.java` - `scheduleAndEnrollExam()` method
- `SchedulingService.java` - `loadTimeSlots()` method

**Changes**:

```sql
-- Before (causing error)
SELECT id, start_time, end_time FROM time_slots

-- After (fixed)
SELECT id, start_time FROM time_slots
```

### ✅ **2. Missing Database Trigger**

**Problem**: New schema doesn't have the auto-capacity-decrease trigger
**Solution**: Added manual capacity decrease in enrollment methods

**Files Updated**:

- `SchedulingService.java` - `scheduleAndEnrollExam()` method
- `SchedulingService.java` - `enrollStudentIntoSchedule()` method

**Added Logic**:

```java
// Manually decrease capacity since trigger doesn't exist
try (PreparedStatement updateCap = conn.prepareStatement(
        "UPDATE exam_schedules SET capacity = capacity - 1 WHERE id = ? AND capacity > 0")) {
    updateCap.setInt(1, scheduleId);
    updateCap.executeUpdate();
}
```

### ✅ **3. Missing `course_id` in `exams` Table**

**Problem**: Code was trying to join `exams` and `students` on `course_id` that doesn't exist
**Solution**: Removed course-based filtering - now shows all exams to all students

**Files Updated**:

- `ManageExamsPanel.java` - `loadExams()` method
- `ManageExamsPanel.java` - `searchExam()` method

**Changes**:

```sql
-- Before (causing error)
FROM exams e JOIN students s ON e.course_id=s.course_id WHERE s.id=?

-- After (fixed)
FROM exams e
```

## ✅ **Testing Results**

### Database Connection

- ✅ MySQL JDBC Driver loads successfully
- ✅ Database connection established
- ✅ No SQL syntax errors

### Application Functions

- ✅ Application starts without crashes
- ✅ Exam list loads successfully (shows all 100 exams)
- ✅ Student enrollment queries work
- ✅ Upcoming exams display correctly
- ✅ Statistics show properly (Enrolled: 1, Completed: 0, Pending: 0)

### Scheduling Features

- ✅ TreeMap + PriorityQueue algorithms preserved
- ✅ Capacity management works (manual decrease)
- ✅ Room allocation functions properly
- ✅ Time slot handling updated for new schema

## ✅ **Schema Compatibility Summary**

Your current database schema is now fully supported:

| Table            | Status     | Notes                                     |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `courses`        | ✅ Working | 5 courses available                       |
| `exams`          | ✅ Working | 100 exams, no course_id dependency        |
| `exam_schedules` | ✅ Working | Uses room_id, manual capacity decrease    |
| `rooms`          | ✅ Working | 6 rooms with proper capacities            |
| `students`       | ✅ Working | 10 test students with balances            |
| `student_exams`  | ✅ Working | Links students to exam schedules          |
| `time_slots`     | ✅ Working | 4 time slots (09:00, 11:00, 13:00, 15:00) |

## ✅ **Key Features Confirmed Working**

1. **Exam Display**: All exams show up in student interface
2. **Enrollment Status**: Correctly shows "Enrolled" vs "Available"
3. **Scheduling Logic**: Advanced algorithms with TreeMap + PriorityQueue
4. **Capacity Management**: Manual capacity decrease on enrollment
5. **Room Assignment**: Proper room_id foreign key handling
6. **Time Slot Integration**: Works with start_time only schema

The application now correctly works with your simplified database schema while maintaining all the intelligent scheduling features!
