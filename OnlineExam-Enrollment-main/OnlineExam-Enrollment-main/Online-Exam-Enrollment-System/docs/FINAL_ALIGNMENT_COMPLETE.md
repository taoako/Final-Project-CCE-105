# 🎯 Complete Database & Code Alignment Summary

## ✅ **MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!**

Your Java application has been **perfectly aligned** with the `exam_enrollment (8).sql` schema and comprehensive test data has been created.

## 🔧 **Schema Alignment Changes**

### **1. Restored Proper exam_schedules Integration**

```java
// ManageExamsPanel.java - Fixed enrollment status check
"CASE WHEN EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM student_exams se JOIN exam_schedules es ON se.exam_schedule_id=es.id WHERE se.student_id=? AND es.exam_id=e.id)"

// ExamEnrollmentSystem.java - Full schedule details restored
"SELECT se.id, e.exam_name, es.scheduled_date, es.scheduled_time, r.room_name, e.duration, se.status, se.is_paid"
"FROM student_exams se JOIN exam_schedules es ON se.exam_schedule_id = es.id"
```

### **2. Enhanced SchedulingService**

```java
// Intelligent exam schedule selection with capacity management
"SELECT es.id, r.room_name, es.scheduled_date, es.scheduled_time, es.capacity"
"WHERE es.exam_id=? AND es.capacity > (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM student_exams se WHERE se.exam_schedule_id=es.id)"
```

### **3. Full Payment Integration**

- ✅ `is_paid` column tracking
- ✅ Payment status display (✅ Paid / ❌ Unpaid)
- ✅ Balance deduction on enrollment

## 📊 **Database Schema Structure**

```sql
